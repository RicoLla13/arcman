# Arcman - Personal project for C++ class

Welcome to the repository containing the game made for the second semester Object Oriented Programming class at Haute École Arc Neuchâtel 🇨🇭.
Here, you will find the source code, build instructions and a little documentation of the project.

## 📈 How to Use

If you want to skip the compilation phase, you can grab the release corresponding to your operating system.

If not, you can go to the [Compilation](doc/compilation.md) section.

In the menus, use W and S to move up and down, and ENTER to select.

In the actual game, use WASD for 4 directional movement. Press P while in the game as a backdoor.
